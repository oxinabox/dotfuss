What is the Fuss about Dotfiles?

This is yet another dotfile management program.
right now it is in super-alpha -- basically an empty repo.

It is eventaully going to be govened by the idea, that "Dotfiles are ment to be Branched" (not forked branched.)
Each computer you are one will have its own branch, and files common to sets of computers,
will have those files be merged across.
